The Minesweeper game is a puzzle-based game where the player must uncover all non-mine tiles without detonating any mines. Using logical thinking and strategy, the player needs to reveal safe tiles and flag potential mines to progress through the game. By successfully uncovering all safe tiles, the player wins the game. However, if a mine is detonated, the game is lost. Challenge yourself and test your logic skills with our Minesweeper implementation!
